        <p>IAM - <strong> Identity </strong> Access Management: Framework of business policies ensuring right identities can access organization’s data.</p>
        <p><strong>Identity </strong>Refers to an individual app / bot. <strong>Important:</strong> Set automation, access management</p>
        <p>IGA (<strong>Identity</strong>  governance and Administration / lifecycle mgmt framework) Complies w/ SOX, HIPAA, GDPR ensuring right control are in place</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Identities → Humans: No Employees/Employees</p></li>
            <li><p>Identities → Machines: AI bots Streamline/Machine Learning automatic flow</p></li>
        </ul>



        <p><strong>IGA Campaigns</strong> Implemented for a manager to whether approve or reject identity access at every review cycle considering SOX, HIPAA... </p>

        <p><strong>Mgment </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Role Based Access Control RBAC: Includes bots & policies are assigned by the roles</li>
                <li>Access Request Process ARP: User requests access → Manager approves</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Policies </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>General: It's a single condition</li>
            <li>Separation of Duties: Individual has two or + access capabilities. Individual goes from IT to business dpt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SNow ←→ SPoint</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Business Rules:  tables, workflow, asset mgmt within instance</li>
            <li>Policies: Governance Rules, HRA compliance access</li>

        <h1>ISC Identity Security Cloud </h1>
        <p>Used to see what services in the Cloud/SaaS systems are being used and by Who?</p>

        <p><strong>ISC and IIQ</strong> covers data access security (Who can access the folder where the file exist?) and <br>
        Secure Unstructured data (What's actually inside the file, certain words within a PPT)</p>

        <p><strong>ISC is built on top of ATLAS microservices arch.</strong></p>

        <div class="comparison">
            <p><strong>AWS ≈ ATLAS</strong></p>
            <p>EC2, S3, RDS ≈ Life cycle mgmt, Access Reviews</p>
            <p>AWS console (its the GUI ≈ ISC<br>
            it excludes SDK, CLI, etc.)</p>
        </div>

        <table>
            <tr> <th colspan="2"><h2>ATLAS Microservices</h2></th></tr>
            <tr><th>Model</th><td>≈ Same like a model in MVC</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Machine Learning</th><td>≈ Tensor F. or PyT, but not as deep in NN arch (uses own agents)</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Insights/Reports</th><td>≈ Tableau</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Connectivity</th><td>≈ The back-end layer of each microserv.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Orchestration</th><td>≈ SNow/SForce flows or triggers</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Standardize processes to be automated - Leaver Process</li>
            <li>Aim processes to best practices - Don’t close a campaign w/ undecided access</li>
            <li>Gather agreements/expectations from different groups and users</li>
            <li>Budget time to test system integrations - Sandbox test → Production</li>
            <li>Verify data and standardize it to automate</li>
            <li>Learn to recognize among data load processes and system errors</li>
            <li>Prepare personnel for the upcoming changes</li>
            <li>Product deployment is an ongoing commitment</li>

        <h1>Work Streams / Common Path / Business Drivers</h1>

        <h2>Work Streams</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mgmt Scoping: Proper documentation before deploying</li>
            <li>Platform Network: Scale Virtual Appliances (VA - Reconfigured linux machines for SP's use) accordingly.</li>
            <li>Data Identity: Place external identities in Authoritative Systems (Separated db for external identities)</li>
            <li>Application: Aim to build centralized workflows ensuring scoped apps are using them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Business Drivers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Information Security: + Security - audit funding. <b>CP → TC → AM → LM → PM</b></li>
            <li>Financial Operating: - operation cost + profit margins. <b>CP → PM → LM → AM → TC</b></li>
            <li>Operation Productivity: + productivity. <b>CP → PaM → AR → AM → LM</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Path CP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity Foundation: Authoritative Systems in scoped apps, key applications</li>
            <li>Advanced Analytics: Verify data is correct and clear</li>
            <li>Access Insights: Capture access history ASAP to hlup AI/ML</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>TC - Targeted Cert.: IGA access review campaigns, process can be automated by AI</li>
            <li>AM - Access Modeling: Bundles the access services of business or birth role access</li>
            <li>LM - Lifecycle Mgmt: Leverage access models to automate lifecycle events</li>
            <li>PM - Policy Modeling: Surface violations that need to be reviewed and actioned</li>
            <li>PaM - Password Mgmt: Password reset calls, self service implementation</li>
            <li>AR - Access Request: Enhanced with AI recommendations to expedite user requests without governance control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identity Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Least Privilege: People only have the access they absolutely need</li>
            <li>Automated Provisioning: Seamless employee access changes in their business lifecycle</li>
            <li>Access Certifications & Separation of duties</li>

        <h1>Compliance Audit</h1>
        <p> It regulates laws, rules, and standard of an organization, there are all type of audits having different audit frameworks</p>

        <h2>Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex processing during daily account aggregation</li>
            <li>Custom code, dig deeper in req. to find an equivalent in the system</li>
            <li>Unsupported interfaces in IdentityNow</li>
            <li>Testing in production, only sandbox</li>
            <li>Using hardware/software that does not meet SP's requirements when accessing SP</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transform</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SP: Used in IdentityNow to manipulate attributes with no coding 'converting_case', concatenating, conditional(logic) used in identity orchestration</li>
            <li>SN: An attribute should be modified automatically if it's found in a .csv, they built on top of 'Import Sets'.</li>
        </ul>

Acquire the SP tenant 400 points
Check the courses from Silvana
Talk with Jang WeChat







Salesforce 2 frameworks  Ligthing and VisualForce.

Auth toke is required to have access to the development environment locally.

New User/Profile:
>Setup>Users>Profiles -> It has objects & fields settings to change/modify access lvl for users
>Setup>Users>New User

Campaign Type: Required (Value, Record, Page Layout)
A campaign can be created from a prospect Obj.

-To Organize fields in layout - go to objects

-Workflows:
>Setup>Process Automation

-Lead Order
Cient Mapping >Setup >Custom MetadataType
To map make sure they same data type

To see Reports: >Setup >'search bar' Reports

To extends a class we use 'virtual' in the method and class

SFObject <--> db tables
SFField <--> db columns
SF Record <--> db row
Objects automatically created by SF are named 'Standard Objects'
Onjects manually created are named 'Custom Objects'
